# 🐄🌱 Animal & Plant Health Management System  
### Mount Olive Farm House – Smart Farm Management System

>My primary responsibility in the Farm Management System project was the design and development of the Animal and Plant Health Management module, implemented using the MERN stack with real-time monitoring and IoT integration.

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Animal & Plant Health Management System** is a core module of the **Mount Olive Farm House – Smart Farm Management System**, developed as part of our **2nd Year 2nd Semester Information Technology group project**.

This module focuses on monitoring, managing, and maintaining the health status of farm animals and plants through a centralized web-based system. It helps farmers track health records, identify issues early, and make data-driven decisions to improve productivity and sustainability.
